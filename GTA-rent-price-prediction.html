            <p>The goal of this project is to visualize the current housing prices on the market in the Greater Toronto Area. 
                The idea of this project came after wondering how long and how much I would need to save (as a student/recent grad) 
                to afford a house in Toronto. I then thought it would be interesting comparing these housing prices to the average income 
                of their neighbourhood, and see if there were any outliers.</p>
            <p>The data used in this project was scraped from Zillow and features 20 pages worth of housing data.</p>
            <p>This project is still in progress. The web scraping is now complete, and this data will soon be show on 
                plotted on the map of Toronto featured above, along with the average income in each neighbourhood.</p>
